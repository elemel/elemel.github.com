I am a software developer living in Gothenburg, Sweden with my family. I am
employed by Epsilon as a consultant. I am also one of the owners of Beliber.

In my spare time I develop even more software. You can find my trail of
inactive open-source projects starting at SourceForge.net, crossing Google
Code, and ending at GitHub, which I prefer these days. Maybe I will migrate my
old projects to GitHub. I also have a number of unreleased projects from the
past few years. The minimal overhead of GitHub is a catalyst for cleaning them
up and releasing them.

My four-year-old son can write his own name: viggo

My younger son is named Love (pronounced Lou-veh). He is still at home with my wife, Angelique, but will attend preschool starting February next year. Viggo and Love get along fine most of the time, though they are keeping us busy, as they should be.

Angelique blogs in Swedish at "Studio Agnes":http://studioagnes.blogspot.com/. My blog is simply called "Elemel":http://elemel.blogspot.com/. I will probably move it to my GitHub Pages in the near future.
