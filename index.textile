I'm a programmer living in Gothenburg, Sweden with my wife "Angelique":http://studioagnes.blogspot.com/ and our sons Viggo and Love. I work on the "Beast":http://gameware.autodesk.com/beast at "Autodesk":http://usa.autodesk.com/. I've always been fascinated by games, and I enjoy making them on a hobby basis.
