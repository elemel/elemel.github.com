I am a software developer living in Gothenburg, Sweden with my family. I am
employed by Epsilon as a consultant. I am also one of the owners of Beliber.

In my spare time I develop even more software. You can find my trail of
inactive open-source projects starting at SourceForge.net, crossing Google
Code, and ending at GitHub, which I prefer these days. Maybe I will migrate my
old projects to GitHub. I also have a number of unreleased projects from the
past few years. The minimal overhead of GitHub is a catalyst for cleaning them
up and releasing them.
