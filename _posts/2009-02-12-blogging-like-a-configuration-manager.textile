title: Blogging Like a Configuration Manager

I've hosted my personal web site and blog at GitHub Pages for a few weeks now. GitHub Pages relies on Jekyll, and I've come to like Jekyll a lot. That said, a minor issue I've run into is how to organize unpublished posts. Let me outline the solution that I've come up with.

# As usual, use today's date in the file name of the new post, whether or not you expect to finish it today.
# If you don't finish the post in one go, create a new branch named after it and commit your work.
# Keep editing the post until you're happy with it. You can have multiple branches at the same time, one for each post that you're working on.
# Optionally, push your branches to GitHub for backup.
# Ready to publish a post? Change its date to today's date, and merge its branch into the master branch. Push the master branch to GitHub.

Now I can work on multiple posts in parallel, list them with the @git-branch@ command, preview them locally with the Jekyll-launched web server, keep them backed up at GitHub, and publish them independently of each other.
