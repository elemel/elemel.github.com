title: On Vacation
---

I'm ten days into my three-week vacation. It started with a train ride to Dalarna, to visit my mother and sister. The wife and kids had gone there a week ahead of me. I took a walk along the river with my wife and my sister. It almost felt like twenty years had not passed. We stayed in Avesta for the weekend before catching the train back to the west coast of Sweden.

Back home in Gothenburg, we've painted the living room all white, met with friends on a couple of occasions, and gone to "Universeum":http://www.universeum.se/. We saw "Revolutionary Road":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0959337/ yesterday. What a great movie.

Tomorrow, we're going to VÃ¤rmland to visit my father. We'll go fishing, and have our annual crayfish party, one of the few times a year that I enjoy some akvavit. Here's to vacation.
