Here are some games that I've written. Most of them could use some more love.

h2. Nucleus

"Nucleus":http://github.com/elemel/nucleus/ is a fast-paced puzzle game, where you score points by constructing words from a nucleus of bouncing and spinning letters. Bonus points are awarded for words formed from adjacent letters. After assembling the required number of letters, you receive a hearty time extension and advance to the next level.

You need a word list to play. Nucleus works out of the box on Ubuntu 9.04, using the system's English word list. On other systems, you may need to get your hands dirty. "Grady Ward's Moby project":http://icon.shef.ac.uk/Moby/ offers some public-domain word lists.

Nucleus depends on "pyglet":http://www.pyglet.org/ and "pybox2d":http://code.google.com/p/pybox2d/.
