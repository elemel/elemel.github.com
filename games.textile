Here are some games that I'm working on. Most of them could use some more love. I write games in Python, using "pyglet":http://www.pyglet.org/ and "Rabbyt":http://matthewmarshall.org/projects/rabbyt/ for graphics, "pybox2d":http://code.google.com/p/pybox2d/ for physics, and "GIMP":http://www.gimp.org/ and "Inkscape":http://www.inkscape.org/ for content.

h2. Nucleus

*Status:* Playable
*Dependencies:* "pyglet":http://www.pyglet.org/, "pybox2d":http://code.google.com/p/pybox2d/

"Nucleus":http://github.com/elemel/nucleus/ is a fast-paced puzzle game, where you score points by constructing words from a nucleus of bouncing and spinning letters. Bonus points are awarded for words formed from adjacent letters. After assembling the required number of letters, you receive a hearty time extension and advance to the next level.

In "Cannonball":http://github.com/elemel/cannonball/, you control a ball that has a cannon fixed onto it. The cannon spins with the ball, which means that you use the same controls to move the ball and aim the cannon.
