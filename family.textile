My four-year-old son can type his own name: viggo

My younger son is named Love. He's still at home with my wife, Angelique, but will attend preschool starting February. Viggo and Love get along fine most of the time, though they keep us busy, as they should.

Angelique blogs in Swedish at "Studio Agnes":http://studioagnes.blogspot.com/. I got her a "Flickr Pro account":http://www.flickr.com/photos/anqh/ for Christmas.
